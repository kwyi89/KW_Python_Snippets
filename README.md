# Python Snippets Created By KW

All the Python Snippets in this repo were rewritten by KW solely for the purpose of studying Python.
A lot of the examples were found from the web!!
IPython was first used to write and execute these Python codes and later converted to .py files to be uploaded here.
This is why you see unnecessary "In [ ]" here and there.

Some files contain more than one snippet. The filename should indicate so by stating more than one name.
Otherwise, there must be some comments written within the file to indicate the starting point of a new Python snippet.
